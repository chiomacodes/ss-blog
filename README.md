Welcome to my portfolio page!

- When you open the homepage, you will see that it is wrapped by the navbar which has three tabs: Home, About and Contact, along with two buttons called 'Login' and 'Sign Up' and the footer, which has active social media links for connection and a copyright symbol, along with a designer nametag of 'Chioma Codes'.
- The homepage consists of three blog posts which have active links to their original posting place.
- The 'About' page has a brief description about the foundation and primary purpose of the blog site, as well as its future intentions. 
- The 'Contact' page displays a form to leave your name, email and message. In another column is a simple display of a Linkedin profile icon link and a location.
- Each tab can be toggled with ease and the social media links load immediately.

- I hope you enjoy! Thank you for reading :)
